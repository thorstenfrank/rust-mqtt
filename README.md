# rust-mqtt
An implementation of the [MQTT protocol](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html) in rust.

This project is solely a basis for developing a series of training exercises for learning the language itself, so 
there are no external dependencies (yet) that make life easier. Or would seem sane to use.
There are also obviously no efforts to go `no_std` or take embedded requirements into consideration.
